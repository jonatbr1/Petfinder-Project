Questions To Ask

Profiling:
1) Geographic concentrations by breed in absolute terms, as a % of the overall breed, and % of adoptable pets in that region
2) Breed breakdown by age, sex, size, mixed
3) How many purebreds vs mutts
4) Share of the adoptable population by characteristic
5) How many similar dogs within X miles
6) For mutts, what are most common mixes i.e. a Boxer is often crossed with a Pit
